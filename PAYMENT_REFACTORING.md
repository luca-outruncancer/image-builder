# Payment Service Layer Refactoring

## Overview
This refactoring establishes a clean and modular architecture for handling Solana-based payments within the image board application. It separates payment logic from UI components, provides consistent error handling, and improves state management throughout the payment flow.

## Files to Remove
The following files can be completely removed as they've been replaced by the new payment service layer:

1. `src/utils/solanaPayment.ts` - Replaced by `src/lib/payment/solanaPaymentProvider.ts`
2. `src/lib/transactionStorage.ts` - Replaced by `src/lib/payment/paymentStorageProvider.ts`

## Key Components

### 1. Core Types and Interfaces (`types.ts`)
- Defined standardized types for payment states, errors, and responses
- Created error categories for better error classification and handling
- Established interfaces for payment requests, responses, and metadata

### 2. Payment Utilities (`utils.ts`)
- Created helpers for generating payment IDs and handling errors
- Implemented utility functions for error detection and categorization
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors

### 3. Blockchain Integration (`solanaPaymentProvider.ts`)
- Abstracted Solana blockchain interactions into a dedicated provider
- Implemented support for both SOL and token-based payments
- Enhanced error handling with specific error categories and recovery strategies
- Added transaction verification and confirmation logic

### 4. Database Integration (`paymentStorageProvider.ts`)
- Implemented database synchronization with Supabase
- Created transaction record management and status updates
- Ensured database state reflects blockchain state
- Added transaction/image status coordination

### 5. Core Payment Service (`paymentService.ts`)
- Implemented the main payment orchestration service
- Added payment session tracking and lifecycle management
- Created timeout handling for pending payments
- Provided consistent error handling and recovery

### 6. React Integration
- Created a React context for payment state management (`PaymentContext.tsx`)
- Implemented a custom hook for React components (`usePayment.tsx`)
- Added providers for application-wide access to payment services

### 7. UI Component Refactoring
- Refactored Canvas components to use the payment service
- Simplified UI state management and error handling
- Created clean separation between UI and payment logic

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Payment logic is now isolated from UI components
   - Each aspect of the payment flow has a dedicated module

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Errors are now categorized and properly handled
   - User-friendly error messages are generated automatically
   - Recovery strategies are implemented for different error types

3. **Enhanced State Management**
   - Payment state is tracked consistently across components
   - Database and UI states are kept in sync
   - Timeout handling prevents stuck payments

4. **Better User Experience**
   - More informative feedback during payment process
   - Clearer error messages when issues occur
   - Smoother payment flow with proper state transitions

5. **Code Maintainability**
   - Modular structure makes future changes easier
   - Consistent patterns across the payment flow
   - Reduced code duplication

## Implementation Notes

No changes to the database structure were required for this refactoring. The implementation works with the existing tables:

1. **transactions** table: `transaction_id`, `image_id`, `sender_wallet`, `recipient_wallet`, `transaction_hash`, `transaction_status`, `amount`, `token`, `timestamp`, `retry_count`, `blockchain_confirmation`, `last_verified_at`

2. **images** table: `image_id`, `image_location`, `start_position_x`, `start_position_y`, `size_x`, `size_y`, `image_status`, `created_at`, `confirmed_at`, `last_updated_at`, `payment_attempts`, `payment_final_status`, `sender_wallet`

## Next Steps

1. Update unit tests to work with the new payment service layer
2. Add additional error recovery strategies
3. Implement payment analytics and monitoring
4. Consider adding support for additional blockchain networks
